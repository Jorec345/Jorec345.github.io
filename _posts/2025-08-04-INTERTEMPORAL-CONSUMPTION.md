# Understanding Intertemporal Consumption and Savings
#### *Inter-temporal Choice*
- Inter-temporal choice is economic explanation for how current decisions and action affect the options and choices one has in the future. This simply implies that an individual has to make a choice between two periods which is the current period and the period when on is retired. 
- Inter-temporal choice entails spending, and savings habits which can affect current and future. 
- Inter-temporal choice applies to both individuals and businesses. For example, when one chooses to NOT consume today it means they are saving the money, the money will come in handy in the future when the income levels are not the same as at present. 
- The whole inter-temporal choice theory is preference based theory. One may prefer to balance savings and consumption at any time.

#### *Life cycle Model*
- According to this model consumption is based on average lifetime income and not income at a specific time, season or age.
- The model postulates that at the beginning of ones lifetime when they start to earn, they borrow to consume more than the income. With time their income rises and they start to save more.

- During ones retirement they start to consume their life savings. 

#### *Critics of the model*
- This theory has faced certain critics with some claiming that the predicted behavior deviates from the actual behavior since people under-consume in their early days and fail to borrow in their later years. Additionally, people end up not saving enough to finance retirement income.
- Another critic is that as income increase peoples consumption patterns also change and they begin to consume more.
- Additionally, interest rate encourage borrowing and present consumption which leaves people paying principle and interest to the later years of their lives. This means that savings are reduced and hence future consumption. 
- The model doesnt consider factors such as job loss which may occur at any point in time of the curve.


#### Proposition
- Despite there being deviations between the expected and the actual behavior. An emphasis needs to be put to encourage individuals to abide by the models proposition to make better decisions.


- Some of the key things to pick from this model for better financial decision-making:

    - Plan with a long term mind. Create a long term budget which includes the different life stages such as education, working years and retirement. That way you are financially covered throughout your life time.
    - Smooth the consumption. One needs to limit drastic changes in lifestyle based on short term or temporary income changes. 
    *A salary bonus should not warrant moving to Kilimani because it is a short term income change.*
        - Additionally, one should save more during high income seasons to help stabilize the life cycle.
    - Save more and save early. Small savings for a long period often have a compounding effect.
    - Interest rates are your best friend when looked at from an investment point of view. When interest rates are high it means your savings are more rewarding. Moreover, you can use interest rate changes to guide your borrowing and investing. 
    - Avoid over borrowing. The life cycle model assumes rational borrowing, however the reality is debt burden is a big problem for many even countries and businesses.
        - Only borrow when income is predictably reasonable and the predicted income is sufficient to cover the loan. 
    - Think beyond income. It should not just be chasing paycheck after paycheck. 
        - Allocate your income in such a way that it helps you build wealth. Focus on building wealth. 
    - Base your consumption decisions on permanent income and not temporary income.

#### Conclusion
Understanding inter-temporal consumption provides a powerful lens through which we can make smarter financial choices. Rather than reacting to short-term income changes, this model encourages us to think strategically—balancing today’s needs with tomorrow’s goals. By planning ahead, saving during high-earning periods, and being mindful of how we allocate resources over time, we can achieve greater financial stability and long-term well-being.

Ultimately, the key is to view money not just as a means for immediate gratification, but as a tool for building a secure and fulfilling future. Whether you're just starting out or planning for retirement, the principles of inter-temporal choice can guide you toward more informed and resilient financial decisions.
