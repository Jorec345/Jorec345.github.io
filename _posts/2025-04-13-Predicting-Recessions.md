### *Predicting Recessions Using Macroeconomic Indicators*

A recession is a period of declined economic activity often lasting more than just a few months. 
Economic recessions often have great impact on businesses, investments and policy decisions. The traditional approach to predicting recession has heavily relied upon expert judgment which entails observing the GDP for two consecutive quarters. If the GDP is negative for two consecutive quarters then the general judgment is that there is recession. However, machine learning and econometric models can be employed and can provide warning signals by analyzing trends and patterns in historical macroeconomic data.

#### Key Indicators
There are several key indicators that aid in predicting recession that this blog will highlight.

1. Unemployment rate and Jobless Claims
- Unemployment rate can be used as an indicator for economic distress however, it is sometimes counter-intuitive. What am i saying, you may ask?
- Employers are often reluctant to lay off workers during an economic downturn because of the costs involved in hiring new employees. 
- Therefore this means that the unemployment rate may not spike at the onset of the recession but rather when the economy is in recovery.
- A great example would be during the 2008 Global financial crisis where the GDP declined between Q4 2007 and Q1 2008, however during this time there was no spike in the unemployment rate. The spike came between the mid to late 2008.
- This shows when making a judgment on recession unemployment rate should not be the sole base.

- On the other hand, the jobless claims can give a better picture of the economy. 
- In Kenya, we do not have unemployment benefits and therefore it may be had to use the data to estimate the number of people who have been unemployed in a given period.
- A rise in the number of jobless claims often precedes the likely unemployment 

2. Yield Curve Inversion/ Credit Spreads 
- Recession can be predicted from the spread between Long-Term and Short-Term Interest Rates for example taking the difference between interest rates of a 10 year treasury bill and a 2 year treasury bill.

- A yield curve inversion implies that investors expect slower growth or contraction in the future.

- When we take a look at corporate bonds and treasury bonds, when there is a widening spread there is a high likely of default risk which implies economic recession.

3. Real GDP and Industrial Production
-  GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy.
- A recession can be declared where there has been two consecutive negative quarterly GDP reported. 
- The GDP often signals that a recession has already begun.
- For example, during the 2008 recession, the GDP during Q1 and Q2 in 2008 were never confirmed until mid 2008 which signified that the recession had already begun.

### * Approaches to Forecasting Recession*
1. Logistic Regression
- Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning technique often used for binary classification. This means that it only has two outcomes to choose from.
- In our case the presence of a recession or not.
- 
2. Machine Learning Approaches
- Traditional econometric models struggle to predict recession because of the characteristics of economic data. That is, the non linear relationships and structural breaks present in economic data.

- Machine learning methods come to account for the short falls of the traditional econometric models. Machine learning is also effective when handling high dimensional data.

1. Tree Based Models 
- These include, Random Forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM

- The most common tree based model often used by many is the Random Forest which helps with feature analysis and also handling mixed data types.

2. Neural Networks
- These include LSTM's and Transformers.
- The most commonly used is the transformers which is best for handling sequential data (time series data)

- 

3. Support vector machines

- This approach is very useful where the data set is small and is clearly defined

- However it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

4. Ensemble methods
- This is a machine learning techniques that gives better model predictions by combining two or more learners e.g regression models, neural networks.

- The methods under this include: boosting, bagging and stacking.

- Ensemble methods help reduce bias and variance in an effort to boost model accuracy.
