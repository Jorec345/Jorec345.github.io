The world is going digital right from health care, manufacturing and many more and now capital markets.

For a very long time the common assets classes that we have known or recognized have been equities, bonds and derivatives. However right now we have a new class of instruments which are slowly penetrating the market - the tokenized assets. 

Asset tokenization is the conversion of the ownership rights of an asset to a digital ledger or token on a blockchain platform therefore creating a digital representation of the asset.

This kind of conversion creates both liquidity and efficiency because it also comes with the possibility of division which implies that one can own a fraction of an asset. This aspect of fractional trading which means that previously inaccessible assets because of insufficiency to buy the whole asset are now accessible. 

This can easily be confused with cryptocurrency, however, the difference is that cryptocurrencies are native digital assets while tokenized assets are tied to real world financial instruments.

Global markets have began adding these assets into their markets in different ways including
- Tokenized bonds
- Tokenized money market funds
- Fractional tokenization of real estate and private equity.

### One would ask why tokenized assets as opposed to the traditional assets
The traditional assets and tokenized assets differ in terms of execution. With tokenized assets, one can instantly transfer, programmable features and one can also have fractional ownership of an asset, therefore creating more liquidity.



### Challenges to regulators
The regulators primary role is to ensure stability in the capital and financial markets. Therefore the challenges of tokenization include:
- Investor protection: In the spirit of ensuring stability the regulator by ensuring transparency and stability.
- Systemic stability: Preventing new channels of contagion if tokenized assets scale rapidly.
- Global standards.Building cross-jurisdictional harmonization as markets adopt tokenization at different speeds.

### Risks and Challenges Ahead

Despite its promise, tokenization faces hurdles:

- Cybersecurity risks: Hacking or wallet compromises remain a major threat.

- Fragmented standards: Lack of interoperability across blockchain platforms could fragment liquidity.

- Valuation uncertainty: How should tokenized instruments be priced when secondary markets are shallow?

- Legal ambiguity: In disputes, who legally owns the underlying asset â€” the holder of the token or the entity managing the ledger?
